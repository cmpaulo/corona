About the project
-----------------

Observing the worldwide tendency to ignore some diseases that can become a pandemic, I have decided to give my contribution for understanding the COVID-19 pandemic in Southeast Brazil. This pandemic is demanding more knowledge of its behavior for the prediction and estimation of cases from tables of data collected from the global health agencies. These routines are still very primary, but we can already observe some behavior that we can predict or estimate with models of evolution of the infection (I) of healthy individuals (S) that can kill (D) these or let these (R, E) live.

SIR model is a simple mathematical model for epidemics. Epidemics happen when a disease spread very fast reaching a large number of people in a short period of time. It defines "S" for for the number of susceptible; "I" or the number of infectious, and "R" for the number of recovered or deceased/immune individuals. This model is also missing some elements, such as the creation of new susceptible people by being born, and the removal of susceptible, infected, and recovered people who die.

Getting Started
---------------

This program has a database until March 24, 2020 for the number of confirmed cases for several countries. With the programs you can carry out an assessment of the lethality of COVID-19, and time/number evolution of infections.

### Prerequisites

The list of things that you need to use and how to install them.

* pip
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scipy wget
```

pip install pandas numpy scipy wget

### Installation


1. Get a free API Key at [https://github.com/cmpaulo/corona](https://github.com/cmpaulo/corona)
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cmpaulo/corona.git
```
